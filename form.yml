      - **any** - (*1-28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens. Requesting hugemem nodes allocates entire nodes.
      - **debug** - (*1-28 cores*) For short sessions (= 1 hour) the debug
        queue will have the shortest wait time. This is only accessible during
        8AM - 6PM, Monday - Friday. There are 6 of these nodes on Owens.
    options:
      - [ "any",     "any"     ]

      - **local** - When running tools locally, they are child processes of the Galaxy server. 
        The maximum number of concurrent jobs is the number of cores.
        When session ends, you lose contact with those jobs still running, 
        and they must be restarted.
      - **cluster** - When running tools in a cluster, they are separate processes from the Galaxy server.
        They are jobs submitted to Owens Cluster as configured above and there is no maximum number of concurrent jobs. 
        When session ends, the jobs will continue to run and finish.
    options:
      - [ "local",     "local"]
      - [ "cluster", "pbs" ]
